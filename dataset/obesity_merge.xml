HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: The patient is an 86-year-old woman
with a history of diabetes , chronic kidney disease , congestive
heart failure with ejection fraction of 45% to 50% who presents
from clinic with a chief complaint of fatigue and weakness for
one week. She had had worsening right groin and hip pain , status
post a total hip replacement approximately 13 years ago which had
been worsening for two weeks , and she has also recently completed
a course of Levaquin for urinary tract infection. She presented
to Dr. Parrent office complaining of fatigue and weakness for one
week. She has had some abdominal pain in a band-like
distribution around her right side. She was found to have a
hematocrit of 21 down from 30 eight days ago and was sent to the
emergency department for transfusion and workup of her anemia.

furosemide 80 mg daily , valsartan 120 mg daily , warfarin 4 mg
daily , iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. daily , and multivitamin daily.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Chronic kidney disease , presumed due to
congestive heart failure/diuresis/renal artery disease/early
diabetic nephropathy; type 2 diabetes; previous stroke;
congestive heart failure with ejection fraction of 45% to 50%;
rheumatic valvular disease with mitral valve replacement and
tricuspid valve repair; atrial fibrillation; history of small
bowel obstruction; status post right total hip replacement
approximately 13 years ago.
FAMILY HISTORY: No family history of kidney disease or heart
disease.
SOCIAL HISTORY: She has 10 children , lives alone with home care
in ME , but has moved in to live with her daughter in
News Irv In She denies tobacco use and drinks alcohol rarely.
ALLERGIES: Codeine and Benadryl.
ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs were temperature
96.7 , heart rate 60 , blood pressure 153/74 , respirations 22 , and
SaO2 95% on room air. The patient is a frail elderly woman in no
acute distress. She has poor dentition. JVP is difficult to
assess secondary to tricuspid regurgitation. Lungs were clear to
auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular exam showed bradycardia
with heart rate in the 50s that was irregular , S1 plus S2 with
3/6 systolic murmur heard throughout with mechanical sounding S2.
Abdomen was mildly tender to palpation in the mid epigastrium
with no rebound or guarding. Extremities showed venous stasis
changes in her lower extremities bilaterally. Feet were cool
with diminished DP and PT pulses. On neurological exam , she was
alert and oriented x3 and cranial nerves II through XII were
intact.
STUDIES: EKG showed atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular
response with heart rate of 53 , widened QRS , a Q wave in aVL , and
U waves in the lateral leads.
Chest x-ray showed improved pleural effusions and pulmonary edema , stable marked
cardiomegaly.
X-ray of the right hip showed ,
1. Status post right total hip arthroplasty with stable
periprosthetic lucency and cortical remodeling.
2. Severe left hip osteoarthritis.
3. Diffuse atherosclerosis.
EGD on 10/24/06 showed hiatal hernia , fundic polyps with
pathology showing hypoplastic and inflammatory lesions; mild
antral erosions with pathology demonstrating mild regeneration
that was nonspecific and no H. pylori; and duodenitis with
pathology showing normal mucosa but no active bleeding or signs
of recent bleeding.
Capsule endoscopy on 7/5/06 showed a healing gastric ulcer likely in the
antrum , small bowel lymphangiectasia and angioectasia in the distal small
bowel.
Colonoscopy on 9/12/06 demonstrated cecal diverticulum , approximately 3-mm
ascending sessile polyp and several small sessile polyps in the rectosigmoid.
PROCEDURE: Right basilic vein transposition on 9/12/06 by Dr.
Jacinto Goonez .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM:
1. GI bleed: In the emergency department , the patient's vital
signs were temperature 95.4 , heart rate 62 , respirations 16 ,
blood pressure 127/66 with SaO2 98% on room air. She was found
to have black guaiac positive stool and GI was consulted. She
was started on IV Nexium 20 mg b.i.d. and was given vitamin K 10
mg subcutaneously and two units of FFP , and she was transfused
three units of packed red blood cells with Lasix 120 mg IV for
each bag. Of note , the patient had a colonoscopy in
Wa on 8/26/05 , which showed bleeding rectal ulcers with
biopsies consistent with ischemic colitis. An EGD on 10/24/06
showed a hiatal hernia; fundic polyps ( path:
hypoplastic/inflammatory ); mild antral erosions ( path: mild
regeneration , nonspecific; no H. pylori ); duodenitis ( path:
normal mucosa ) , but no active bleeding or signs of recent
bleeding. Capsule endoscopy on 7/5/06 showed healing gastric
ulcer likely in the antrum , small bowel lymphangiectasia and
angioectasia in the distal small bowel , which were considered the
likely sources of bleeding. Colonoscopy was performed on
9/12/06 to search for angioectasias for which intervention would
be possible , but demonstrated only a cecal diverticulum and
approximately 3 mm ascending sessile polyp and several small
sessile polyps in the rectosigmoid. The patient was started on
Aranesp but had a 5-point hematocrit drop from 32 to 27 on
9/12/06 for which she required another two units of blood along
with Lasix. The patient's hematocrit remained stable at
approximately 30 to 32 and she will be restarted on
anticoagulation on Thursday , 12/10/06 , one week after her AV
fistula surgery.
2. Renal: The patient has chronic kidney disease and is being
considered for a possible hemodialysis in the future. She was
continued on her Caltrate plus D , multivitamin , and iron
supplementation and she was started on Aranesp 25 mcg weekly and
was given sevelamer 400 mg q.a.c. for elevated phosphate levels.
Vein mapping study was performed on 7/25/06 , and a right basilic
vein transposition was performed on 9/12/06 by Dr. Landrie . The
patient had postoperative right hand coolness , numbness , and
weakness ( always with dopplerable radial pulse ) from steal
versus neurapraxia , which was improved by the time of discharge.
She will follow up with Dr. Chanthasene as an outpatient. The
patient's creatinine was 3.3 on admission , improved to 2.0 by
9/12/06 , which was the day of her surgery and increased again to
3.2 on 1/10/06 .  She was given IV Lasix boluses as she had
evidence of volume overload with over eight-pound weight gain
during her hospitalization , and creatinine improved to 2.7 by the
day of discharge.
3. Cardiovascular:
Pump: The patient's ejection fraction is 45% to 50% and she was
given 120 mg of IV Lasix for each unit of packed red blood cells
she received , along with 120 mg p.o. daily with IV boluses of 180
mg as needed for volume overload as judged by an increase in her
weight. Antihypertensive medications were originally held for
her GI bleed and they were restarted on 10/24/06 with systolic
blood pressures remaining in the 120s to 130s.
Rhythm: The patient has atrial fibrillation with slow
ventricular response with heart rates as low as the upper 30s.
Occasionally , her heart rate appeared regular and was thought to
be junctional escape rhythm. She was asymptomatic throughout her
hospitalization. She was discussed with her cardiologist , Dr.
Fritz , who will consider a pacemaker as an outpatient.
4. Endocrine: She is euthyroid with TSH of 2.422. For her
diabetes , she received nightly Lantus with aspart q.a.c. and
sliding scale when eating and Regular insulin sliding scale q.6h.
when n.p.o. Fingersticks were elevated to 300s early during this
admission but improved to the 100s upon increasing her insulin
dose.
5. Musculoskeletal: The patient is status post right total hip
replacement approximately 13 years ago and complained of right
hip pain upon admission. An x-ray showed stable arthroplasty and
the pain was improved by the morning of 10/24/06 .  She will
follow with physiatrist , Dr. Allan Kofoed .
COMPLICATIONS: Right hand weakness , numbness , and coolness
status post AV fistula surgery , possibly secondary to steal or
neurapraxia , significantly improved by the time of discharge.
CONSULTANTS: Dr. Garfield Kiehne from vascular surgery , Dr. Ambrose Moldrem from gastroenterology.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON DISCHARGE: Stable vital signs. Lungs
with bibasilar crackles. 3/6 systolic murmur heard throughout
plus a mechanical S2. Abdomen benign. Lower extremities with
chronic venous stasis changes. Right upper extremity AV fistula
with +thrill. Decreased right radial pulse with warm
hand distally , and 4/5 strength in hand grip of the right hand.
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Norvasc 5 mg daily , Caltrate plus D one
tablet p.o. b.i.d. , Aranesp 25 mcg subcu weekly , Lovenox 50 mg
subcu daily starting on Thursday 12/10/06 ( to be discontinued when patient's
INR is therapeutic on coumadin ) , Nexium 40 mg p.o.
b.i.d. , ferrous sulfate 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Lasix 160 mg p.o.
daily , insulin aspart 5 units subcu every meal , insulin Lantus 15
units subcu q.p.m. , Imdur 30 mg p.o. b.i.d. , sevelamer 400 mg
